# No SQL Same Great Database Functionality

## Project Description

Billions of people around the world use social media on a daily basis. As a result there's a lot of data that needs to be stored and retrieved -that's where MongoDB comes in. MongoDB's flexibility allows for large amounts of unstructured data to be quickly managed. This application, though not nearly as large as a social media platform, is a basic social media platform back-end API that uses MongoDB in a way that a larger platform might. 

This program uses the following:

* JavaScript
* Express.js
* MongoDB
* Mongoose
* Heroku

## User Story

```md
AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a user’s friend list
```
